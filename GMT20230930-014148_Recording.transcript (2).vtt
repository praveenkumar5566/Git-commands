00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.519
V Cube Software: boomer, friend. Give me 1 s.

264
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.349
Sai: So good morning, Seth.

265
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:25.760
V Cube Software: I couldn't know. We run Campbell Camp Petrota Esto today.

266
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.849
V Cube Software: So one more stage more.

267
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:47.660
V Cube Software: So you'll opening like a volume. They create chest, and when they they need space and equipment.

268
00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:03.010
V Cube Software: So what I'm going to do is just come here. I'm going to create a volume here

269
00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:19.269
V Cube Software: before going to create a volume. I need to check. Okay, one yellow great check for the volume product. So create a volume which is 20 Gb. Volume

270
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.290
V Cube Software: 23 volume.

271
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:30.290
V Cube Software: and create a volume. So once I created a volume. Yes.

272
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:34.399
V Cube Software: once I created a volume, it should be available to attach this

273
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.040
V Cube Software: available. So go here.

274
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.880
V Cube Software: Come here. attach volume.

275
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.190
V Cube Software: see the instance. Bed shop running.

276
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.780
V Cube Software: Come down

277
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.700
V Cube Software: and then attach volume.

278
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.449
V Cube Software: Okay, let it be

279
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.340
V Cube Software: go here. Say.

280
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:03.700
V Cube Software: SLPL. Kit. So 20 Gb. Volume.

281
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:07.400
V Cube Software: Yes.

282
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:16.469
V Cube Software: it is attached, but not come into the picture. Get it all, I think for this we need to do few things.

283
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.130
V Cube Software: What are those

284
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.880
Virginia

285
00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:48.170
V Cube Software: to check, whether you have file system or not? File high finance.

286
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.870
V Cube Software: slash, dev

287
00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:57.900
V Cube Software: slash XV. Of XVDF. So let's say, enter

288
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:13.820
V Cube Software: so no file system, illa file system, and except for all raw value to create a file system. MK make Fs make the aff and and make Fs file system. So once the file system hyphen B,

289
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.060
V Cube Software: so X Fs is a file system.

290
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.949
V Cube Software: slash, dev slash, XVDF.

291
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.230
V Cube Software: Enter

292
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.600
V Cube Software: now to check whether we have a file system or not. Up arrow

293
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.170
V Cube Software: a better.

294
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.059
V Cube Software: We have a file system now

295
00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:39.889
V Cube Software: and then when they're allowed to make class definition of data.

296
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:45.309
V Cube Software: Yes. Now, we need to create a

297
00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:58.819
V Cube Software: Directory folder to mount this file system.

298
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.070
V Cube Software: Dfi fun excellent.

299
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:10.420
V Cube Software: Df, hyphon hits anand disco, free space

300
00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:25.009
V Cube Software: is already in the 7.6 gp. 2.9. Yes, okay, 8 62 MOUN mount

301
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:33.030
V Cube Software: flash down slash X Vdf. and then

302
00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.670
V Cube Software: Mount Point is root. And

303
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.170
V Cube Software: yes. although little don't.

V Cube Software: the

543
01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:51.339
V Cube Software: but test be as usual.

544
01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.259
V Cube Software: See this past, Dot, Dot. and let's open them.

545
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:08.089
V Cube Software: Okay, let's see this pipeline

546
01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:22.490
V Cube Software: dependency check completes that 3 min. That is okay. Come down.

547
01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.939
V Cube Software: completed the dependency checker.

548
01:14:57.450 --> 01:15:00.490
V Cube Software: So here is the a report that we got.

549
01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.619
V Cube Software: This is how the dependency check works.

550
01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:14.519
V Cube Software: server-side processing success, pet shop success.

551
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.400
V Cube Software: So do refresh.

552
01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:27.979
V Cube Software: Come down now. You are able to see the dependency check. Let us click here

553
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.019
V Cube Software: dependency check result. This is how it works.

554
01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.380
V Cube Software: So privy. So what do you do is

555
01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:44.250
V Cube Software: if you want to install TV, I need to go here, and then you need to

556
01:15:45.810 --> 01:15:53.120
V Cube Software: here this first. So how you can clear this. basically. So do refresh

557
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:02.240
V Cube Software: unless

558
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.400
V Cube Software: puddle hyphen.

559
01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.650
V Cube Software: I think I unless

560
01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:15.580
V Cube Software: bf, iphones

561
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:21.969
V Cube Software: 68%. If I run this job once again, it is going to fill because

562
01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:25.750
V Cube Software: the space won't be enough. So

563
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:27.300
V Cube Software: for that.

564
01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:38.409
V Cube Software: we need to increase the phone size. Very simple.

565
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:41.449
V Cube Software: It's very simple. I'll tell you how to do this.

566
01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:48.180
V Cube Software: There is a tree here, this. Come up. come down, come down

567
01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:49.990
V Cube Software: after Jenkins.

568
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:58.159
V Cube Software: there is inflation of docker, there is inflation of trivia. So install this trivia and follow the

569
01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.970
V Cube Software: steps over here.

570
01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.590
V Cube Software: Same steps. You know these steps.

571
01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:52.640
V Cube Software: yes, and then

572
01:17:56.890 --> 01:18:03.889
V Cube Software: so this is how it looked like the dependence check. Come down. Is this

573
01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.240
V Cube Software: dependency check?

574
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:29.879
V Cube Software: So I'll stop it. Here.

575
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:35.090
V Cube Software: stop this.
